# running-biomechanics-analysis
Python-based data processing and systematic review synthesis for running biomechanics and movement profiles.

## Research Focus
The goal of this project is to synthesize existing biomechanics data to inform public health physical activity initiatives and identify factors contributing to injury in new runners.

## Technical Skills & Methods
* **Data Processing:** Utilizing Python for cleaning and analyzing large-scale retrospective movement datasets.
* **Analysis Techniques:** Implementation of clustering (K-means) and waveform-based analysis.
* **Systematic Review:** Methodology for bibliographic database searching and literature synthesis.

## Research Integrity
All work is conducted in accordance with university research governance frameworks, prioritizing data integrity and ethical guidelines.
